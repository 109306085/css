<p class="p">
	<span>Aladdin</span>, a classical tale by Arabian nights has been revised and changed over time to covey a more appropriate moral. In the original tale Aladdin does not tell his princess, merely just an object of naive beauty, who is he really is and the source of all his riches. He uses magic and wealth to satisfy his mother, his wife, the sultan and the people of the community. As a result, the tale fails to give an appropriate moral, however over time, the tale was edited to serve a powerful message making it a timeless tale.
